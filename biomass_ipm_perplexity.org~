```scratchpad
[AttentionFocus:
PrimaryFocus: Connection between angle of repose, particle friction, and Mohr-Coulomb's angle of internal friction
SecondaryElements: Reynolds' claim, physical mechanisms, experimental studies
PotentialDistractions: Detailed mathematical formulations, unrelated soil properties]

[RevisionQuery: What is the relationship between the angle of repose, particle friction, and the Mohr-Coulomb angle of internal friction, and are there studies examining their physical connections?]

[TheoryOfMind:
UserPerspective: Seeking clarification on Reynolds' claim and looking for more recent research on the topic
AssumptionsAboutUserKnowledge: Familiar with basic soil mechanics concepts
PotentialMisunderstandings: Confusion about the distinction between different friction angles]

[CognitiveOperations:
Abstraction: Identifying key concepts across different studies
Comparison: Contrasting Reynolds' claim with more recent findings
Inference: Drawing connections between particle-level interactions and bulk material properties
Synthesis: Integrating information from multiple sources to form a coherent understanding]

[ReasoningPathway:
Premises:
1. Reynolds claimed no physical connection between angle of repose and particle friction
2. Angle of repose, particle friction, and Mohr-Coulomb angle of internal friction are related concepts in soil mechanics
3. More recent studies may have explored these relationships
IntermediateConclusions:
1. There may be a disconnect between historical understanding and modern research
2. Particle-level interactions likely influence bulk material properties
FinalInference: Modern research has likely established some connections between these concepts, but the relationships may be complex and dependent on various factors]

[KeyInfoExtraction:
1. Reynolds claimed no physical connection between angle of repose and particle friction
2. Angle of repose is generally close to the angle of internal friction for granular materials
3. Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion relates to the angle of internal friction
4. Particle shape, size, and surface properties influence friction angles
5. Microscopic mechanisms affect macroscopic behavior of granular materials]

[ContextAdherenceTLDR: The response addresses the connection between angle of repose, particle friction, and Mohr-Coulomb's angle of internal friction, considering both historical claims and modern research.]

[Exploration:
1. How do modern experimental techniques allow for better understanding of particle-level interactions?
2. What role does particle shape play in determining friction angles?
3. How do environmental factors (e.g., moisture, temperature) affect the relationship between particle friction and bulk material properties?
4. Are there any computational models that accurately predict friction angles based on particle properties?
5. How do the relationships between these friction angles change for different types of granular materials?]

[Metacognition:
StrategiesUsed: Comparative analysis, historical context consideration, synthesis of multiple sources
EffectivenessAssessment: 85 - Good integration of information, but could benefit from more recent experimental data
AlternativeApproaches: Could have focused more on specific experimental studies or computational models]
